# &chi;MCF Images of Seam-weld Cross-sections

Images of seam-weld cross-sections date back to April 2011 and where kindly provided by Siemens, then still LMS.

File [Table_of_Contents.txt](Table_of_Contents.txt) provides a list of the files together with their initial time stamps.

In the course of ISO 8329 preparation, some of these files have been updated, other derived as variants. 

The table in "Figure 49 &mdash; Seam weld types and attributes" has been re-worked as an embed-able Excel file.
