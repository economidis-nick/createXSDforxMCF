## Submission & Document Status
**WG chair reports:** 
The document incl. XSD schema was submitted to ISO. <br/>
ISO requested some format adjustments:
* Figure captions. 
* Table captions. 
* Footnotes not recommended. To be replaced by standard "NOTE"s. 
* Figure & Table numbering in annex. 
* Word "must" is allowed only in cases of externally, unalterable requirements. <br/> Internally use "shall" or "has too". 
* Examples must be numbered, if more than one in a section. 
* "Hanging paragraphs" are not allowed. Where required, subsections "General" / "Overview" etc. have been inserted.

Changed version was re-submitted. <br/>
All the pictures were submitted separately, too. <br/>
They [will appear on GitHub](https://github.com/economidis-nick/createXSDforxMCF/commit/39450d4d9ab8dca799ab65aa88eabfdb96d411f9) 
after the meeting.

Now, another ISO quality team will review the document, again.

Week of May 23rd will be next "ISO week". <br/>
WG chair was requested to give a presentation to the "convener" of 
[ISO/TC 184/SC 4/WG 12](https://standards.iteh.ai/catalog/tc/iso/0552bc54-21f6-4550-b526-533f082a0a7b/iso-tc-184-sc-4-wg-12) 
(May 12th, afternoon).

If all is fine, next "Ballot" with 6&ndash;8 weeks duration will be started.


## New Speaker 
WG chair [@mweinert-611](https://www.github.com/mweinert-611) will retire by end of May 2022. 

As successor, he suggests following team: 
* [@DrCaFr](https://www.github.com/DrCaFr): Responsible for technical matters
* Halvar Schmidt (BMW): Responsible for networking, e.g. in VDA FAT AK 25
* Ulrich Fox (Ford): Speaker, responsible for formal invitations, running meetings, keeping ISO contact

Since there are no dissenting votes, the proposal is accepted.
