### Abstract

Complex technical systems such as a car are typically assembled from thousands of parts and components, which each have individual properties. A plethora of different methods is established for connecting such parts in industrial manufacturing. Depending on the developments stage, this happens either virtually or physically. Mating is a core aspect that accompanies a product from design to simulation, testing, and production, and has decisive impact on its behavior in the end. Throughout product lifecycle, characteristics such as durability and maintainability become of importance.

The information that defines a connection element or process (i.e., geometry, mating components, supplemental materials, process configurations etc.) can be very detailed and comprehensive. In addition, numerous engineers work simultaneously on the development of a product, where each engineer is interested in a different aspect of this information. Depending on the context, the same mating element may be described in several different ways. Hence, the necessity for a standardized description of all connections throughout all CAx process steps increases. 

Under the aegis of working group 25 “Fügetechnik” of FAT/VDA, the &chi;MCF (Extended Master Connection File) format was developed for the Automotive Industry. It fulfills this demand and made its way to daily productive use.

&chi;MCF is designed so that all common mating elements are defined in a generic way based on their geometric specification (0d, 1d, 2d). &chi;MCF models the topological relationships between the mating components as well as all relevant information (related to geometry, processing and manufacturing), which is needed for a complete definition of the connection element. &chi;MCF can be used as a container or as a database, and is easily extensible to cover new mating technologies and process information. 

In &chi;MCF, the definition of a single connection can be extended step by step, starting from a basic information subset. This enables the dynamic integration of &chi;MCF into a development process. All parties involved in the process can easily access the data which is of particular interest to them.

With the help of &chi;MCF, a continuous process chain between e. g. CAD, CAE and CAM can be established with regard to mating information. This promises significant gains in efficiency. Current &chi;MCF versions have been implemented in several CAE tools, such as MEDINA®, LMS VirtualLab® and Femfat®. Upcoming version &chi;MCF 3.0 is scheduled for implementation in further tools by end of 2015. 
&chi;MCF is being applied in daily business during technical development, e.g. at Volkswagen, targeting for extension from CAE to larger process chain, including CAD and CAT.
