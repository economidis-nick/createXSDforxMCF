# White-Paper Extracts

This folder features following extracts,
which PROSTEP collected for a 2016 white paper:

- [figures-from-WP.pptx](./figures-from-WP.pptx) &mdash; some STEP AP 214 block diagrams wrt. describing part matings
- [screw_connection.jpg](./screw_connection.jpg) &mdash; example STEP structure, featuring 3 connections, 
                             one of them a screw with washer and nut between "3. Blech" and "4. Blech".
- [screw_connection.xml](./screw_connection.xml) &mdash; the corresponding STEP file for the JPG above.
- [xMCF-reference.xml](./xMCF-reference.xml) &mdash; a STEP example, referring to a &chi;MCF file.
- [Y-joint_min.xml](./Y-joint_min.xml) &mdash; a minimal STEP example of a Y-joint.
- [Y-joint_full_new.xml](./Y-joint_full_new.xml) &mdash; same STEP example with some annotations and optional data.
                             `<ShapeElement/>` contains some of &chi;MCF-characteristic-information. 
                             These would become obsolete, if STEP and &chi;MCF files are used in conjunction.
