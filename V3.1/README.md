# xMCF v3.1 specification

This folder contains:

1. A v3.1 **document**, with the *proposed* changes with respect to its predecesor, v3.0.
2. The **schema file** that captures the v3.1 specification 
3. **Examples** that accompany the v3.1 document
4. A **test suite**, used to develop the schema

ultimately, when the document changes and the xsd are confirmed, we will place the final pdf with the official specification document in this folder.

**Note 1**: test suite contains a validator, which you can use to validate your xmcf files against the schema.

**Note 2**: the schema is best viewed using the Altova XML Spy, because it is quite complicated and writted in xsd1.1
