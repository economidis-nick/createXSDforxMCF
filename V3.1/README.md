# xMCF v3.1 specification

This folder contains:

1. A v3.1 document, with the *proposed* changes with respect to its predecesor, v3.0.
2. The schema file that captures the v3.1 specification 
3. A test suite, used to develop the schema
4. Examples that accompany the v3.1 document

ultimately, when the document changes and the xsd are confirmed, we will place the final pdf with the official specification document in this folder.

Note: test suite contains a validator, which you can use to validate your xmcf files against the schema.
