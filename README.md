# Create XSD for xMCF
<em>Question CF: Don't we want to use the Greek letter 'χ', as in 'χMCF'?</em>

We are building the XML schema for xMCF 3.0. 
xMCF is the extended Master Connection File, a standard of storing connection files for the Automotive Industry. 
The project has been initiated by VDA. 

The xMCF 3.0 format specification has been described in text, without a schema. 

We have made slight corrections to the original document, and 
we are developing the schema, as well as complete examples to accompany the documentation.

In order for us to test-drive the development the schema, we have built a test suite.

## Folder Contents

#### `V3.0/` contains:
the original specification document and pdf

#### `V3.1/` contains:

* the corrected specification document, 
* the developed xMCF3 schema, and
* the accompanying examples for the updated document
* a `test_suite` used for test-driven development of the schema
