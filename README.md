# Create XSD for &chi;MCF (aka xMCF)

We are building the XML schema for &chi;MCF 3. 
&chi;MCF is the extended Master Connection File, a standard of storing connection files for the Automotive Industry. 
The project has been initiated by VDA. 

The &chi;MCF 3.0 format specification has been described in text, without a schema. 

We have made slight corrections to the original document, and 
we are developing the schema, as well as complete examples to accompany the documentation.

In order for us to test-drive the development the schema, we have built a test suite.

## Folder Contents

#### `V3.0/` contains:
the original specification document and pdf

#### `V3.1/` contains:
* the corrected specification document, 
* the developed &chi;MCF3.1 schema, and
* the accompanying examples for the updated document
* a `test_suite` used for test-driven development of the schema

#### `V3.1.1/` contains:
* the improved specification document V3.1.1, 
* the developed &chi;MCF3.1 schema (yet _unchanged_), and
* the accompanying examples for the updated document
* a `test_suite` used for test-driven development of the schema
